Please note that this is not a personalized plan, and it's always best to consult a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for specific recommendations.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n* Your weight is not provided, so I'll assume you're looking for a general healthy diet plan.\n* Your activity level is moderate (e.g., light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week).\n\n**Daily Caloric Intake:**\nA suitable caloric intake for you could be around 1800-2000 calories per day, considering your height and age.\n\n**Macronutrient Breakdown:**\nAim for:\n* Carbohydrates: 45-55% of daily calories\n* Protein: 15-20% of daily calories\n* Fat: 20-35% of daily calories\n\n**Meal Plan:**\nHere's a sample meal plan:\n\n1. **Breakfast**:\n\t* Oatmeal with fruits and nuts (300 calories)\n\t* Whole-grain toast with avocado and eggs (250 calories)\n2. **Lunch**:\n\t* Grilled chicken breast with brown rice and mixed vegetables (400 calories)\n\t* Whole-grain pita with hummus, cucumber, and tomato (350 calories)\n3. **Dinner**:\n\t* Grilled salmon with quinoa and steamed broccoli (400 calories)\n\t* Lentil soup with whole-grain bread (400 calories)\n4. **Snacks**:\n\t* Fresh fruits and nuts (150 calories)\n\t* Carrot sticks with hummus (100 calories)\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n* Limit your intake of sugary drinks, saturated fats, and processed foods.\n* Adjust the portion sizes based on your individual needs and activity level.\n\nThis is just a starting point, and you may need to make adjustments based on your specific requirements. I recommend consulting a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to create a personalized diet plan.",
